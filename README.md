The idea: _value level_ resolving. You get a strongly typed AST of the query (from a schema-specific AST generated by the `refine_schema` macro), you return a weakly typed response, which gets coerced to the required response shape before being sent.

* Fully asynchronous

What you get: more or less a query AST. The grammar of that AST is defined by your `.gql`schema.

You have to construct a corresponding `json::Value` by yourself.

```rust
enum QueryField {
    Pizzas
}

struct Query {
    fields: Vec<QueryField>
}
```
